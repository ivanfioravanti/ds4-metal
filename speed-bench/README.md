## Benchmarking

Session handoff (Aug 21 decode campaign): see
`speed-bench/DECODE-CAMPAIGN-HANDOFF.md` for the cold-restart kit — verified
baselines, the closed-avenue list, tool usage, and the decision required
before resuming work toward >45 t/s.

Here we collect prefill and generation speed obtained with different hardware.

Run `ds4-bench` as:

```
./ds4-bench \
  -m ds4flash.gguf \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt \
  --ctx-start 2048 \
  --ctx-max 65536 \
  --step-incr 2048 \
  --gen-tokens 128
```

Provide PR including your numbers if your hardware was not already tested.
Call the benchmark csv file something like `m3_max.csv` or alike, so that
it is clear what hardware was used for the benchmark.

To generate an SVG graph from a CSV file:

```
python3 speed-bench/plot_speed.py speed-bench/m3_max.csv --title "M3 Max t/s"
```

The script uses only the Python standard library. By default it writes a file
next to the CSV using the `_ts.svg` suffix, such as `speed-bench/m3_max_ts.svg`.

### DSpark speculation on M3 Ultra (measured, not yet profitable)

DSpark non-strict decode was measured end to end on M3 Ultra with the MXFP4
model and the 0731 support GGUF.  Three systemic costs keep it below plain
decode (~43.7 t/s) today; scheduler tuning alone cannot fix them:

1. The verify pass runs the speculative suffix through the generic batch
   prefill kernels (`metal_graph_encode_layer_batch`): ~46-60 ms per verify
   vs the ~29-33 ms memory floor for two rows (the extra routed-expert reads
   are inherent).  A commit-only stage decomposition showed a uniform
   1.5-2.5x per-stage excess (routed MoE 14.3 ms vs 5.9 decode, HC pre
   7.2 vs 1.7, output projection 7.1 vs 4.8, attention 4.4 vs 2.1).
   The fix is the N<=6 microbatch verifier on the decode-grade kernels that
   the verifier's own header comment calls out as "not yet" written.
   Caution for that build: three measured increments (per-row MoE, per-row
   HC pre, and a strict-oracle-verified dual-row HC-pre kernel) each
   recovered nothing, and the batch MoE already runs at its distinct-expert
   floor.  The honest reading is that the ~29-33 ms "perfect sharing"
   verify floor is not deliverable on this GPU; the N=2 verify near 50 ms
   is close to its real floor, so speculation is unlikely to beat the
   43.7 t/s plain decode on M3 Ultra with this model.
2. The draft propose chain costs ~3-8 ms/cycle and its confidence gate
   (`sigmoid(confidence0) >= threshold`, Metal default 0.6) declines on
   45-75% of cycles; each such cycle still pays the propose before falling
   back to one plain decode.  Plain decode inside a DSpark session measures
   a normal ~23.3 ms (the hidden-state capture is not a decode tax).
3. Per-cycle bookkeeping (checkpoint, snapshot, commit, propose-fail
   waste) accounts for a further ~4-5 ms/cycle beyond the measured
   propose+verify+decode components.

Scheduler and confidence knobs were swept: `DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_NO_DRAFT_SKIP=0`
(retry the draft every cycle) raised proposals from 91/179 to 125/147 cycles
and accepted drafts to 101 (80.8% accept); the best combination measured
39.5 t/s at `--dspark-confidence 0.75` on a code prompt, still below the
43.7 t/s plain-decode equilibrium.

A genuine dual-row HC-pre producer kernel (one F16 mix-weight fetch serving
both rows, each row keeping the one-row kernel's exact reduction trees) was
also built for the N=2 verify.  Correctness was proven with the strict-mode
oracle — `--dspark-strict` output matched plain decode byte-for-byte — after
fixing a buffer-index mismatch that silently misbound five kernel arguments
(the strict oracle is the right validation tool for any verify-kernel work).
Measured honestly, per-verify cost was unchanged (~52 ms, n=4, vs ~50 ms
rollback over 57 verifies) and the diverged non-strict token stream made the
draft decline on 99% of cycles: the serialized hc_pre share had been
overestimated by the stage decomposition, and the win is not there.

Two dispatch-routing microbatch increments were also built, validated, and
measured negative before reverting: per-row routed MoE through the
single-token static-trip kernels (bit-identical output, verify_layer
unchanged at 1225 vs 1217 ms) and per-row HC pre through the decode fused
producer kernel (valid non-strict output, 39.3 vs 40.2 t/s).  Both show the
verify excess lives in the batch kernels' execution, not in dispatch
routing; the microbatch build must write genuine small-N batched kernels.  Strict mode (`--dspark-strict`)
measures 43.07 t/s, i.e. no gain, as accepted blocks are re-run through
one-token decode to stay byte-identical.

### Metal decode stage GPU counters

The end-and-wait stage profiler (`DS4_METAL_DECODE_STAGE_PROFILE=1`) adds a
synchronization per stage boundary and changes the schedule, so its numbers
are inflated by per-boundary waits.  The stage-counter diagnostic keeps the
production token mostly intact: every stage boundary commits the open batch
command buffer without waiting, so the GPU queue stays fed, and each stage's
GPU busy span is printed after the token:

```
DS4_METAL_DECODE_STAGE_PROFILE=1 DS4_METAL_STAGE_COUNTERS=1 ./ds4 -m ds4flash.gguf \
    -p "Write a short story." -c 8192 -n 24 --temp 0
```

Both env vars are required: the first arms the boundary macros, the second
switches them from end-and-wait to commit-only sampling.  The concurrent
shared-expert/routed-MoE overlap stays armed under counters (only the
serializing profiler disables it), but the per-stage command buffers queue in
order, so overlapped stages report their serialized costs.  The per-token
`total-cb-busy` line matches the production GPU-busy time (about 22.5 ms on
M3 Ultra at a short context), which is the check that the attribution is
faithful.  M3 Ultra decode at a short context attributes the token roughly as:
routed MoE 5.9 ms, attention output projections 4.8 ms, Q lora path 5.1 ms
(Q-A/KV/compressor quad kernel 41 us + Q-B matvec 59 us per layer), attention
core plus inverse RoPE 2.1 ms, router/shared gate-up 1.9 ms, and about 3.4 ms
of per-layer HC pre/post bookkeeping, with the remaining dense Q8_0 matvecs
streaming at 590-650 GB/s, i.e. at the memory wall.

### Metal decode raw-layer gathered attention A/B (45 t/s round, part 1)

Decode attention has two schedules with a per-layer-parity split: ratio-4
layers use the gathered path (fused KV staging with pad fusion + packed32
attention with fused inverse RoPE, two dispatches), while ratio-0/128 layers
with `n_comp == 0` used a five-dispatch raw path (ring copy, standalone pad,
vec, plain reduce, standalone RoPE tail).  Commit-only stage counters showed
the raw layers at ~65 µs versus ~32 µs — about 0.7 ms/token, hidden in the
averaged ledger.  Decode now routes `n_comp == 0` layers through the gathered
path (the staging kernel already handles `n_comp == 0`; the packed32 gate's
`n_comp != 0` term is relaxed) whenever `use_mask == 0`.  Same kernels, same
reduction topology; the routing change is packaging only.  Rollbacks:
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_RAW_GATHERED_ATTN` (raw path) and
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_RAW_PACKED32` (staged vec+reduce instead of
packed32 on raw layers).

```
./speed-bench/metal_decode_schedule_bench \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_RAW_GATHERED_ATTN \
  --include-selection --tokens 512
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B at the harness's 2048-token prefix: 43.18/43.10 t/s
(+0.16%; only layers 0–1 qualify once odd layers hold compressed rows), all
529 frontier rows / 68,389,120 logits / 528 selected ids bit-identical.  In
the campaign CLI regime (short prompt, `-n 128`), interleaved runs gave
44.59/44.67 t/s new versus 43.52/43.40 t/s rollback (+2.7%), transcripts
md5-identical (`db0c504c…`).

### Metal greedy chain decode A/B (45 t/s round, part 2)

The classic one-shot decode loop serialized every token through the host:
`waitUntilCompleted`, a 517 KiB logits readback, a CPU argmax, then the next
token's encode — about 0.5 ms/token of GPU idle at the boundary.  Chained
greedy decode (`metal_graph_greedy_chain`, engaged by
`generate_metal_graph_raw_swa` when resident, non-quality, non-streaming,
greedy) keeps the token id on-device: each token's graph ends with the GPU
argmax writing the next id into a device ring, and the next token's embedding
gathers it from the ring.  Encoding runs two tokens ahead of the host's
confirm cursor, so command buffers are always committed before the GPU drains
the previous token; the host lags only to print and check stop tokens (one
shared-event wait per token, hidden by the encode-ahead).  The hash-layer
router select reads the id from the ring through the existing
`use_token_buffer` kernel argument; the host-side hash override is skipped
(the resident fixed-route MoE never consumes it).  Bit-exactness: all kernels
and inputs are unchanged, and the GPU argsort top-1 reproduces the CPU argmax
including lowest-index ties, so the transcript is identical.
`DS4_DISABLE_GREEDY_CHAIN=1` restores the classic loop;
`DS4_GREEDY_CHAIN_DEBUG` / `DS4_GREEDY_CHAIN_DUMP_IDS` are diagnostics.
Interleaved M3 Ultra CLI runs: 45.47/45.55 t/s chained versus 44.73/44.73
classic (+1.75%), transcripts md5-identical; at a 2K-token prefix 44.12/43.40
(+1.7%); a 1024-token run and an early-stop prompt matched md5 exactly.

Combined round state: 43.46 → 45.51 t/s (+4.7%), bit-exact, `make test`
44/44.

### Session greedy chain (ds4-eval) + two headroom probes (Aug 22, round 3)

**Session chain decode** brings the round-2 chain to the session API used by
`ds4-eval`.  `ds4_session_chain_greedy_supported` /
`ds4_session_eval_chain_greedy` (ds4.c, next to `ds4_session_eval`) drive
`metal_graph_greedy_chain` on an existing session graph: seed = CPU argmax of
`s->logits` (identical to the classic temp-0 sample), pos0 =
`checkpoint.len`, approved tokens pushed into `s->checkpoint` by a trampoline
only after the caller's callback approves them; on full completion
`logits_out = s->logits` preserves the session logits invariant (on early
stop the logits are stale — eval only stops early on stop-token/quit/switch,
where they are never read).  Guards mirror the CLI set plus session state:
no GLM/CPU/distributed/TP/multi-tier, `support_kind == DS4_SUPPORT_NONE`, no
ssd-streaming/quality/CPU-router/steering, same env kill switch
(`DS4_DISABLE_GREEDY_CHAIN=1` forces the classic loop everywhere).

`ds4-eval` decodes in bursts (eval_chain_on_token carries the classic loop's
per-token bookkeeping verbatim).  Bursts are capped to stay out of the
think-close controller window (`remaining - soft_limit` while thinking, len>1
closes use the hard window) — inside the window the classic step runs, so
forced (non-argmax) closes behave identically.  Verified bit-exact: 3-case
traces (`--questions 3 -n 4096`, think and `--nothink`) identical except
volatile timestamp/seed/elapsed fields; per-case answers, token counts, and
think_close records match.  Speed: **45.22–45.24 t/s chained vs
44.44–44.59 classic** (+1.5%) on the eval cases; CLI oracle unchanged
(`db0c504c…`, 45.90 t/s), `make test` 44/44.

**Probe 1 — MoE down-sum6+HC4 tail fusion** (landed, default ON; rollback
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_MOE_HC_FUSION`): layer tail reordered to
pair-SwiGLU → plain shared-down matvec → new
`kernel_mul_mv_id_mxfp4_sum6_fixed_route_full_rows_static_hc4_f32`
(metal/moe.metal) doing the down-sum6 + `shared_out` add + HC4 expand in one
dispatch, eliminating the `routed_out` f32 materialization and one kernel
boundary per layer.  Bit-exact (md5 n=128/512, harness bit-identical,
wrap-safe); **speed-neutral** — the old path already fused HC into the
shared-down kernel, so only a 16 KiB round trip was removed against the
26 MB expert stream.  Kept: one less dispatch and a simpler tail.

**Probe 2 — KV-staging direct read** (landed, default OFF; opt-in
`DS4_METAL_ENABLE_DECODE_RAW_DIRECT_KV`, hard-off
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_RAW_DIRECT_KV`, loud
`DS4_METAL_REQUIRE_DECODE_RAW_DIRECT_KV`): packed32 attention variant reading
the raw F32 ring and comp F16 caches directly (per-row source selection in
QK and PV loops, in-place tail, wrap-safe).  Bit-exact everywhere including a
probe-verified ring-wrap run — **but ~7% slower** (42.1 vs 45.3 t/s): the F32
raw rows (2048 B) are re-read and re-converted by all 64 head threadgroups
every token, ~2× raw-region traffic versus the one-time staging conversion
that amortizes across heads (+30 µs/layer on `attn_inv_rope`).  Confirms the
round-1 lesson: more parallel traffic throttles this GPU.  May still win on
devices with different L2/ALU balance.

Round-3 verdict: the handoff's remaining-headroom list is exhausted — HC
fusion neutral, direct-KV negative, and the concurrent shared-expert stream
(IQ2-gated) is contraindicated by the same throttling evidence.  The
remaining wall−GPU gap is ~0.1 ms/token; further gains need a cheaper MoE or
attention core, not packaging.

### Metal decode head attribution + chain-mode stage counters (Aug 22, 50 t/s campaign item 0)

The ledger's last unattributed ~0.8 ms is now measured; two tooling gaps had
hidden it.  The output head had no stage boundary after the vocab matvec, so
the final `end_commands` command buffer absorbed it, and the greedy chain
never reported counters at all (it also refused to engage under
`DS4_METAL_DECODE_STAGE_PROFILE`).  A `logits` output-stage boundary
(`DS4_METAL_OUTPUT_STAGE_PROFILE=1`) now closes the classic ledger, and the
chain reports per-token counters itself: each token ends with an `argmax`
sample covering the GPU argmax + event-signal tail, and a token's stages are
reported only at its confirm wait (GPUEndTime is unset in flight), with the
encode-ahead tokens' samples compacted for their own later reports.  The
chain now engages under commit-only counters; end-and-wait profiling still
forces the classic loop.

```
DS4_METAL_STAGE_COUNTERS=1 DS4_METAL_DECODE_STAGE_PROFILE=1 \
  DS4_METAL_OUTPUT_STAGE_PROFILE=1 ./ds4 -m ds4flash.gguf \
  -p "Write a short story." -c 8192 -n 24 --temp 0
```

M3 Ultra MXFP4 short-context chain decode (mean of 17 non-ratio-boundary
tokens): the head costs **0.90 ms/token** — Q8_0 logits matvec 0.769
(129280×4096, ~563 MB at ~730 GB/s: at the wall), GPU argmax 0.086 (a full
bitonic descending argsort for top-1 over 505 KiB — ~10× a dedicated
blockwise reduce, so A5's logits-epilogue top-1 fusion can recover most of
it), HC collapse stages 0.045.  The ledger now sums to the total-cb-busy
line: routed_moe 6.86, q_path 5.17, attn_output 4.79, router 1.92, attention
core 1.37, HC pre ×2 1.69, head 0.90 — 22.7 ms with the ~0.7 ms counter
commit tax versus the 21.96 ms production wall.

### Metal prefill stage counters (Aug 22, 50 t/s campaign P2)

The commit-only stage counters now cover prefill.  The batch layer encode
already carried per-stage boundaries; counter mode now labels them
`lNN:stage`, `metal_graph_layer_stage_profile_start` no longer drains per
layer under counters, and `metal_graph_prefill_layer_major` resets/reports
per chunk in both the single-buffer and split schedules (split-path samples
are timing-complete because each layer still ends in `end_commands`).  The
full env set:

```
DS4_METAL_STAGE_COUNTERS=1 DS4_METAL_LAYER_STAGE_PROFILE=1 \
  DS4_METAL_Q_STAGE_PROFILE=1 DS4_METAL_INDEXER_STAGE_PROFILE=1 \
  DS4_METAL_OUTPUT_STAGE_PROFILE=1 ./ds4 -m ds4flash.gguf --prompt-file …
```

M3 Ultra MXFP4 warm-page ledgers (one-shot; the one-shot CLI passes its
progress callback as `display_progress` unconditionally, so ≥32-token
prefills take the per-layer-drain split schedule regardless of TTY — the
P1 target; busy spans below are still faithful):

- n=6 tokens, 337 ms/pass — the per-layer fixed-cost map: routed_moe 1.82
  ms/layer (36 distinct experts × ~14 MB ≈ 0.50 GB ⇒ 0.63 ms byte floor;
  ~3× above it — the small-N GEMM waste P4 targets), hc_pre ×2 1.70,
  output_proj 0.82, shared gate/up+down 1.24, indexer_setup 0.93 per
  ratio-4 layer, compressor 0.57, q_b 0.29, attention 0.26, router 0.25,
  kv_path 0.19.
- n=637, 1391 ms (32 ms/layer): routed_moe 44.4%, output_proj 13.9%,
  attention 9.0%, hc_pre 6.6%, q_b 6.2%, shared_gate_up 4.0%, kv_path 4.0%.
- n=3092, 5184 ms (121 ms/layer): routed_moe 37.6% at **20.6 TFLOPS
  effective** — the compute-bound estimate (~19 TFLOPS ≈ 70% of FP16 MMA
  peak) confirmed from stage data; attention 13.7%, output_proj 15.4%.

Per-layer cost model from the three points: ~8.5 ms fixed + ~36 µs/token
marginal.  Decode oracles unchanged (`db0c504c…` n=128), `make test` passes.

### A1 probe — HC producer tail restructure: measured neutral, reverted (Aug 22)

The fused decode HC producer (`kernel_dsv4_hc_rms_norm_mix_f16_cluster2_
pre_norm`, ~19.6 µs/call ×86/token) was restructured per roadmap A1: the
4×4 Sinkhorn comb parallelized one-row-per-lane (double-buffered shmem
staging, one simdgroup barrier per iteration, redundant per-lane column
normalization in the original order) and the all-thread device seq_cst
fences shrunk to single-lane release/acquire.  Two independent findings:

- **Not bit-exact**: the serial comb's four unrolled rows compile to a
  row-position-dependent reduction tree (cross-row SIMD reassociation); the
  per-lane version lands rows 0/3 one ulp off (rows 1/2 exact), amplified to
  ~6e-8 over the 20 iterations — deterministic, dump-bisected to the comb
  slice (mixes and collapse outputs bitwise identical).  A per-lane rewrite
  cannot reproduce the serial kernel's compiled arithmetic from source.
- **Speed-neutral anyway**: interleaved CLI A/B, 45.90/45.87 vs
  45.92/45.91 t/s — the completion protocol + serial Sinkhorn hold no
  measurable latency; the stage's ~20 µs is dispatch/dependency floor plus
  the phase-1/2 streams, not the tail.  (The one fused dispatch boundary
  costs ~9 µs; cf. hc_flat_norm.)

Reverted; no rollback env retained because the variant was not bit-exact.
A1's 0.7–1.0 ms estimate does not exist in the tail.

### A3 probe — Q norm/RoPE deferral into the attention consumer: blocked by fast-math (Aug 22)

Roadmap A3 (mirror of the landed inverse-RoPE deferral: drop the per-layer
per-head Q RMS-norm + RoPE dispatch by having each packed32 attention
threadgroup redo its head's 512-wide norm + rotation on the raw q_b row) was
built and bisected.  Proven bit-exact: the deferral plumbing (skip at the q_b
site, standalone re-run at the attention site; rollback env
`DS4_METAL_DISABLE_DECODE_Q_NORM_ROPE_DEFER`, fallback-forcing diagnostic
`DS4_METAL_FORCE_DECODE_Q_NORM_ROPE_DEFER_FALLBACK`) and the in-kernel norm
tree emulation (4 simdgroups + zero-padded 32-slot plane + final 32-lane
simd_sum — bitwise on all 64 heads, all layer ratios).  Under
`DS4_METAL_MATH_SAFE=1` the fused path matched the rollback transcript
exactly.  Under the production fast-math library the YaRN rope tail
(three mul-add blend/rotation expressions) contracts differently inside the
attention kernel than inside the standalone kernel: 1-ulp drifts on
compressed layers, and source-level pinning (strict/fma/lerp forms, a
noinline shared helper) either missed ~26 elements or cascaded the whole
kernel's contraction (norm dots included).  Not landable bit-exactly;
reverted.  The (divergent) fused build also measured slower in a single
probe (43.77 vs ~45.5 t/s), so the win may not have been there regardless.
Fusion rule for this codebase: only contraction-free code (explicit
reduction trees, builtins, single muls) may move between kernels
bit-exactly; mul-add chains and transcendental-adjacent blends may not.

### A4 — router_project_select port to pre-M5/MXFP4: closed by analysis (Aug 22)

The M5 kernel folds the top-6 select into the router matvec's last
threadgroup, but computes no shared-expert work.  Traced the MXFP4 resident
decode FFN flow: today 5 dispatches — router+shared gate/up fused (the
shared expert free-rides as extra threadgroups in the router matvec),
select, early shared-down (independent of the MoE), MoE pair-SwiGLU, and
the landed sum6+HC4 tail (folds the shared_out add + HC expand).  Porting
the fused select keeps the count at 5 (router+select, MoE pair, plain sum6,
shared gate/up late, shared-down+HC expand) while losing both overlap slots
and disqualifying the sum6+HC4 fusion (`fuse_moe_down_hc` gates on
`router_shared_done != 0`).  The M5 win is inseparable from the IQ2-gated
parallel-FFN concurrent encoder (`parallel_full_ffn_eligible`), which does
not exist for MXFP4.  No code; not measured because the structure is
dispatch-neutral by direct reading.  The overlap machinery (selected-id
async loads) never engages for resident decode either way.

### Metal commit-only prefill split for display progress (Aug 22, 50 t/s campaign P1)

The `callback_split` schedule (`display_progress != NULL && n_tokens >= 32`)
forced 43 per-layer `end_commands` drains per chunk solely so the progress
bar updated — and because the one-shot CLI passes its progress callback as
`display_progress` unconditionally, even piped one-shot runs paid them.
When the split exists only for progress (`n_tokens <= 2048`, not
streaming/throttle/imatrix/split-profile), each layer now commits without
waiting via `ds4_gpu_flush_commands_progress`, and the bar rides each
command buffer's completion handler (GPU-true timing, no host drain).
>2048-token chunks keep draining (they also bound transient memory).
Rollback: `DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PREFILL_FLUSH_PROGRESS=1`.

Zero arithmetic change: md5 `ed17c76a…` on a 637-token prompt (-n 32) is
identical with/without the flush, the `db0c504c…` oracle holds, `make test`
passes, SSD streaming smoke OK.  Interleaved one-shot M3 Ultra prefill A/B:
**+2.7% at ~250 tokens** (411.5 vs 400.7 t/s), **+1.8% at 637** (541.9 vs
532.0), control at 3092 unchanged (650.7 vs 650.6) — ~17–20 ms per chunk of
drain idle removed.

### A2 probe — MXFP4 dequant constant-space LUT: measured negative, gated off (Aug 22)

The prescribed inner-loop variant: read the 16-entry MXFP4 value LUT
straight from constant space (no threadgroup staging, one less barrier per
threadgroup) in the two decode fixed-route kernels (pair-SwiGLU static,
sum6+HC4 static; templated `LUT_CONST` shares the same bodies).
Bit-identical (harness: 529 rows / 68,389,120 logits / 528 ids exact),
but **−2.7% decode** (42.41 vs 43.59 t/s at the harness's 2048-token
prefix): divergent constant-cache gathers lose to the threadgroup-staged
LUT on this GPU.  The other prescribed variants are blocked structurally:
uchar loads can't vectorize (17-byte block stride ⇒ unaligned), and
register select chains raise ops/byte.  Kept gated OFF (opt-in
`DS4_METAL_ENABLE_MXFP4_CONST_LUT`), matching the direct-KV precedent.
The routed-MoE dequant stays issue-rate-bound; no safe lever found here.

### Metal decode schedule A/B

Build the balanced, same-engine Metal decode comparison with:

```
make metal-decode-schedule-bench
./speed-bench/metal_decode_schedule_bench \
  -m ds4flash.gguf \
  --include-selection
```

The harness prefills two sessions and alternates both variant order and
variant-to-session assignment. It aborts unless every full-vocabulary logit
row is bit-identical and, with `--include-selection`, both variants select the
same non-EOS token. Use `--candidate-env NAME` to measure a rollback control,
or `--help` to compare explicit split schedules.

To compare the default pre-M5 ratio-4 compressor pack/transpose fusion with the
legacy decode path, including token selection, use:

```
./speed-bench/metal_decode_schedule_bench \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_COMPRESSOR_RATIO4_DECODE_PACK_FUSION \
  --include-selection \
  --tokens 1024
```

The pre-M5 one-token Flash attention-output LOW projection also has an exact
fixed-shape Q8_0 kernel. Compare it with the generic rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_decode_schedule_bench \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_ATTN_OUT_LOW_Q8_STATIC \
  --include-selection \
  --tokens 512
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B runs favored the fixed-shape kernel by 0.53%, 0.53%,
and 0.58% at a 2K-token prefix (43.03/42.80, 42.96/42.73, and 43.24/43.00
tok/s) and by 0.48% at an 8K-token prefix (38.44/38.26 tok/s). An independent
IQ2/Q2-model run at 2K gave 44.47/44.23 tok/s (+0.56%). All 1,909 compared
rows, 246,795,520 full-vocabulary logits, and 1,904 selected token IDs were
bit-identical.
Performance was measured on M3 Ultra; the exact host gate covers the shared
M1-M4 Flash shape and otherwise retains the generic kernel.

### Metal prefill variant A/B

Build the balanced prefill comparison. To compare the default resident pre-M5
MXFP4 pair tail-SIMDgroup cull against the original pair kernel, make the
rollback path the candidate:

```
make metal-prefill-variant-bench
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_MXFP4_MOE_MM_ID_PAIR_TAIL_SIMDGROUP_CULL
```

To isolate the default routed-down tail-SIMDgroup cull from the retained pair
default, use its down-specific rollback as the candidate:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_MXFP4_MOE_MM_ID_DOWN_TAIL_SIMDGROUP_CULL
```

For resident pre-M5 MXFP4 prefills of 32 through 2047 tokens, the exact
scatter map, compact pair tile, pair/down tail culls, and down half-LUT now
use the same defaults as the established 2K+ path. Compare the complete
short-prefill extension with its aggregate rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 256 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_MXFP4_MOE_SMALL_PREFILL
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B medians for the tuned path versus the rollback were
112.43/89.25 tok/s at 32 tokens (+26.0%), 111.95/89.30 at 33 (+25.4%),
180.48/142.59 at 64 (+26.6%), 275.72/219.98 at 128 (+25.3%),
389.27/316.93 at 256 (+22.8%), 512.94/439.39 at 512 (+16.7%),
173.94/157.08 at 1024 (+10.7%), and 632.30/593.70 at 2047 (+6.5%). Every
one of the 64 measured runs produced bit-identical full-vocabulary logits.
Performance was measured on M3 Ultra; the guarded default also covers the
shared resident M1-M4 path.

### Metal batch indexer-query pruning A/B

On zero-prefix ratio-4 layers, the indexer query and its per-head weights are
not consumed until the compressed cache grows beyond the 512-row top-k.  The
resident pre-M5 path now skips the otherwise dead Q projection, RoPE, QAT, and
weight projection for batches of at least 32 tokens while the final compressed
count remains at or below top-k.  The indexer compressor and its persistent
cache/state updates are unchanged.  Compare the pruned path with its rollback:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 2048 \
  --warmup-tokens 2048 \
  --repeats 4 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_BATCH_INDEXER_QUERY_PRUNE
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for the pruned path versus rollback was
115.00/112.98 tok/s at 32 tokens (+1.79%), 277.42/273.81 at 128 (+1.32%),
509.19/502.28 at 512 (+1.38%), 606.13/597.65 at 1024 (+1.42%), and
660.17/651.29 at 2048 (+1.36%).  The last eligible prefix, 2051 tokens, gained
1.41%; 2052 tokens was flat, confirming that the query path remains enabled
when the 513th compressed row first makes top-k selection necessary.  All 56
prefill runs and 7,239,680 compared full-vocabulary logits were bit-identical.
A 2051-token prefix followed across the row-513 transition also matched three
full-vocabulary rows and two selected token IDs exactly.  Performance was
measured on M3 Ultra; the guarded path covers resident single-device M1-M4.

### Metal batch Q/KV finalizer A/B

The M3 resident Flash prefill path now follows vLLM's horizontal Q/KV
finalization schedule while retaining DS4's existing Q-head PSO. It dispatches
that exact Q RMSNorm+RoPE kernel concurrently with a KV-only kernel that folds
KV RoPE, the FP8 round trip, F16 rounding, and raw-ring insertion together.
The default covers 128 through 4096 tokens per dispatch; longer contexts use
the normal 4096-token chunks. A 32-token dispatch regressed and 64 tokens did
not clear the 0.3% acceptance threshold. Compare the retained path with its
serial rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 512 \
  --warmup-tokens 512 \
  --repeats 4 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_BATCH_QKV_FINALIZE
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for the concurrent path versus rollback was
273.60/272.63 tok/s at 128 tokens (+0.36%), 502.44/500.37 at 512 (+0.41%),
598.07/595.87 at 1024 (+0.37%), 651.27/649.11 at 2048 (+0.33%), and
615.06/612.37 at 8192 (+0.44%). All 56 prefill runs and 7,239,680 compared
full-vocabulary logits were bit-identical.
A 512-token prefill followed by decode also matched 73 full-vocabulary rows and
72 selected token IDs exactly, covering the persisted raw-cache state. The
schedule is based on vLLM's
[fused DeepSeek V4 finalizer](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/c8de519917ce549f72132952116185e38b37c95d/csrc/libtorch_stable/fused_deepseek_v4_qnorm_rope_kv_insert_kernel.cu#L382-L603),
but keeps Q and KV in separate Metal pipeline states to preserve DS4's exact Q
fast-math code generation.

### Metal prefill indexed-attention four-row staging A/B

The resident single-device pre-M5 indexed-attention prefill path now stages
four raw or F16-compressed K/V rows per threadgroup barrier while consuming
them in the original scalar-kernel row order. The specialization covers
non-quality batches of at least 32 tokens with 64 heads, 512-wide heads,
top-k 512, a 128-row raw window, ratio 4, and more than 512 compressed rows;
SSD streaming, TP2, decode, M5, and other shapes keep the original path.
Compare it with the
one-row staging rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 8192 \
  --warmup-tokens 4096 \
  --repeats 1 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_INDEXED_ATTN_PREFILL_RB4
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for four-row staging versus rollback was
631.53/626.50 tok/s at 4100 tokens (+0.80%),
620.39/614.76 at 8192 (+0.92%), 594.11/589.36 at 16384 (+0.81%), and
557.91/553.71 at 32768 (+0.76%). The 2048-token boundary, where compressed
rows do not yet exceed top-k, was flat. All 16 active-path prefill runs and
2,068,480 compared full-vocabulary logits were bit-identical. A direct forced
kernel oracle also matched all 1,048,576 attention-output floats exactly while
covering raw-ring wrap, visibility stops, and one- through three-row tails.
Separate 8K and 32K prefix-to-decode checks matched 106 full-vocabulary
frontiers, 13,703,680 floats, and 104 selected token IDs. Eight-row staging was
also exact but was 0.17-0.21% slower at the first two screened sizes, so only
the four-row specialization is retained. Performance was measured on M3
Ultra; the guarded default covers the shared resident M1-M4 path.

The same guarded path now groups sixteen heads per 256-thread workgroup by
having each SIMDgroup update two heads from every staged four-row block. This
halves K/V staging and workgroup count without changing either head's row
order or online-softmax arithmetic. Compare it with the accepted eight-head
RB4 rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 8192 \
  --warmup-tokens 4096 \
  --repeats 1 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_INDEXED_ATTN_PREFILL_HEADS16_DUAL_RB4
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for heads16 dual RB4 versus heads8 RB4 was
638.45/629.00 tok/s at 2052 tokens (+1.50%), 651.08/637.46 at 4100
(+2.14%), 640.33/626.12 at 8192 (+2.27%), and 613.72/600.81 at 16384
(+2.15%). The first matched 32768-token pair was 576.10/563.42 (+2.25%);
later slots in that process encountered severe system throttling and are not
used for the comparison. All 28 timed full-vocabulary rows were bit-identical.
The forced direct oracle matched all 1,048,576 attention-output floats and
proved both the dedicated rollback and new selector. Separate 8K and 32K
prefix-to-decode checks matched 94 full-vocabulary frontiers, 12,152,320
floats, and 92 selected token IDs.

### Metal batch MoE sum6-to-HC4 epilogue A/B

The resident single-device pre-M5 MXFP4 prefill path now consumes the six
routed expert-down rows directly in the HC4 expand/add/split epilogue. The
kernel preserves the original `s0 + s1 + ... + s5`, shared-expert add, and HC4
post/comb accumulation order while removing the standalone sum6 dispatch and
the routed-output F32 materialization. The default covers batches of 32 through
4096 tokens; longer prefixes use the normal 4096-token chunks. Debug, profiling,
steering, SSD, TP2, quality, decode, and other tensor shapes keep the original
path. Compare the fused path with its rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 8192 \
  --warmup-tokens 4096 \
  --repeats 4 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_BATCH_MOE_SUM6_HC_FUSION
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for the fused path versus rollback was
663.24/660.81 tok/s at 2048 tokens (+0.37%), 621.83/619.49 at 8192
(+0.38%), 596.50/594.76 at 16384 (+0.29%), and 560.30/558.54 at 32768
(+0.32%). The 32-token point was flat (-0.03%); 128, 512, and 4096 tokens
gained 0.19%, 0.18%, and 0.28%, respectively. All 64 prefill runs and
8,273,920 compared full-vocabulary logits were bit-identical. A direct oracle
also matched all 527,372 HC output floats exactly for a tail shape and the
production 32-by-4096 shape. Separate 8K and 32K prefix-to-decode checks
matched 146 full-vocabulary frontiers, 18,874,880 floats, and 144 selected
token IDs exactly. Performance was measured on M3 Ultra; the guarded default
covers the shared resident M1-M4 shape.

### Metal batch Q8 attention-output-to-HC4 epilogue A/B

The resident single-device pre-M5 Q8 attention-output path now feeds the
aligned 8192-to-4096 output-B matmul tile directly into the HC4 expand/split
epilogue. The specialization preserves the legacy Q8_0 dequantization and
simdgroup-MMA order, stages every 64-by-32 result through an 8 KiB F32
threadgroup tile, and then repeats the original scalar HC4 post/comb
accumulation order. This removes the global F32 `attn_out` write/read and the
standalone HC dispatch without removing the materialized F32 rounding
boundary. The default is deliberately limited to aligned batches of 512
through 4096 tokens; shorter batches, tails, debug/profiling/steering,
quality, SSD, TP2, M5, and other shapes retain the original path. Compare the
fused path with rollback using:

```
./speed-bench/metal_prefill_variant_bench \
  --prefix-tokens 8192 \
  --warmup-tokens 4096 \
  --repeats 2 \
  --candidate-env DS4_METAL_DISABLE_PRE_M5_BATCH_ATTN_OUT_HC_FUSION
```

Balanced M3 Ultra A/B throughput for the fused path versus rollback was
526.16/523.77 tok/s at 512 tokens (+0.46%), 668.43/663.66 at 2048
(+0.72%), 626.47/621.49 at 8192 (+0.80%), and 599.57/596.92 at 16384
(+0.44%). All 44 retained timing runs and 5,688,320 compared
full-vocabulary logits were bit-identical. A direct production-shape oracle
also matched all 262,144 low-rank values and 524,288 HC outputs exactly and
confirmed that the fused path did not touch the dead `attn_out` buffer.
Separate 8K and 32K prefix-to-decode checks matched 14 full-vocabulary
frontiers, 1,809,920 floats, and 12 selected token IDs exactly. A standalone
32K timing process was discarded because sustained thermal throttling changed
slot time from 58 to 142 seconds; the 32K run is correctness evidence only.
Performance was measured on M3 Ultra; the guarded default covers the shared
resident M1-M4 path.

The harness uses one Metal engine and fresh sessions for every run. It warms
both variants with at least 32 tokens, alternates control/candidate order in
ABBA and BAAB blocks, poisons host logit buffers before copying, and aborts
unless every final full-vocabulary logit row is bit-identical. Defaults are an
8192-token prefix, an automatically sized 8193-token context, and two repeats;
use `--help` to override them.
